               Book Review - 
               "I’ve been following Gary Vaynerchuk for about a year now, and I’ve always admired his work ethic and most importantly, his commitment to bringing value both online and offline. I wasn’t expecting this book to be so addictive that I read it in four days (I seriously broke night two days ago reading and rereading several chapters). My favorite part of the book is when he is talking about self-awareness. This theme has been covered not only in this book but, in other books I’ve read by other authors this year (2016) and I have to say that it is essential that we all know who we are.
               After reading this book I now have a better understanding as to why Gary does what he does, and more context around the practical advice he gives. Books help you grow, allow this one to be on your list." - Kenny Soto

                  <blockquote>"Nome, Alaska, 1925. A diphtheria epidemic is sweeping through Nome, and 18 people have already gotten sick. One person is the owner of Jenna, a dog that Balto has a crush on, and who also has a crush on Balto. The town's doctor sends for more diphtheria antitoxin, which Nome is out of. A dog team is sent to Nenana to pick up the antitoxin, but on the way back, there is an accident, and the musher is knocked out. When the team doesn't arrive, Balto goes to help them out. He is, of course, bullied by Steele, his rival. Balto ends up leading the team, and on the way back, has an accident, but proves himself by bringing the antitoxin safely to Nome, and becomes a hero. Steele, on the other hand, gets rejected and is despised by the other dogs." Full story

You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.</blockquote>
